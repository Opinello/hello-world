# hello-world
My start-up

Hello everybody, 

I entered the github via studying processing with the NatureOfCode. Here the very basic Exercise I.2 made me thinking how probability shares affect remaining outcomes and - this is exercise I.3 - how is this rule transformed into rotated coordinates?
Starting point is the assigned probability of 50% to a certain direction, let's say x. The first question arizes how shoud this affect the other directions. Let think simple in this very first approach and say: ok, all the other directions should share the remaining 50%, being 50/3%. No further thinking what this could mean in nature. The next question is more difficult: the random walker only can jump in x, -x, y, and -y. How does this rule transform for these directions of the coordinate system when defining that the 50% is not x but the direction of the mouse pointer?
